# Stock Screener Project

## Overview

The Stock Screener project aims to gather data from the NSE INDIA website for various sector stocks. The primary goal is to analyze this data, identify specific patterns in stock price movements, and develop a screener that can highlight stocks exhibiting particular candle patterns such as Bullish Engulfing, Hammer pattern, etc.

## Project Features

- **Data Collection:** The project leverages data from the NSE INDIA website to obtain real-time and historical stock data for different sectors.

- **Pattern Identification:** The collected data is analyzed to identify various candlestick patterns, which can serve as indicators for potential stock movements.

- **Screener Development:** A web-based screener is built on top of the identified patterns. This screener allows users to filter and list stocks based on specific criteria, making it easier to identify potential investment opportunities.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** The web application is developed using Flask, a lightweight and extensible Python web framework, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the stock screener.

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Front-end technologies are employed to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface for the web application.

- **Python:** The core programming language used for data analysis, pattern identification, and web application development.

- **Web Scraping:** Techniques for web scraping are employed to gather data from the NSE INDIA website.
